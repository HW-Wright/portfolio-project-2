# Ultimate Movie Quiz!
My Second Portfolio Project is a quiz game. The purpose of the site is to engage the user with questions of varying difficulty about films, filmmaking and the movie industry as a whole. The target demographic for this site are teenegers and anyone older. Obviously the appeal will increace the further into movie fandom one goes, but the questions do not require extensive knowledge of cinema history, thus crerating a site for many to enjoy.

##### Features to be added
- In the future I would live to offer a div separate from the quiz area that provides a piece of trivia, that relates to the question, tot he user.
## Design
### Layout
----------------------------
- The layout for my quiz is simple but effective. The site is topped witht he page heading and subheading. The quiz area takes up aprox 75% of the viewport and contains all interactive features of the quiz within it. Below the quiz area there is the score counter.
- Within the quiz area there are 8 elements that the user will interactive with, they are:
* The question area.
* Three pairs of radio inputs and answer boxes .
* A submit button.
### Color Scheme
----------------------------
- The colour scheme of blue and red was chosen for it's classicaly compatible contrast. 
- The page background an image of a red stage curatin, as one would find in an old school or vintage movie theatre; this therefore works thematically as well as astetically. 
- The background for the quiz area and score counter is a rich blue with a soft white gradient. This image was slected puposefully as a solid primary colour can appear basic and unappealing to modern users.
- The font color is an off white marble color, chosen over white to soften the contrast against both the red of the background and the blue of the quiz area.
