# Ultimate Movie Quiz
My Second Portfolio Project is a quiz game. The purpose of the site is to engage the user with questions of varying difficulty about films, film making and the movie industry as a whole. The target demographic for this site are teenagers and anyone older. Of course, the appeal will increase the further into movie fandom one goes, but the questions do not require extensive knowledge of cinema history, thus creating a site for many to enjoy.

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories
----------------------------
#### First Time Visitor Goals
- As a first time visitor, I want to easily be able to perceive the purpose of the site.
- As a first time visitor, I want to easily be able to use the radio and button functionality of the site
- As a first time visitor, I want to have a positive emotional reaction to the site design.
- As a first time visitor, I want all of the above to be true, regardless of screen size.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to have a different experience, i.e., not have the same set of 10 questions as last time.
#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- As a frequent visitor, I want to easily be able to learn from my mistakes and ace the quiz.

### Features
----------------------------
#### Existing Features
##### Page Title and Subheading
- The page title and subheading use thematic font and a soft color to welcome the visitor to the page whilst also explaining the basic purpose and premise of the site.
##### Quiz Area
- The quiz area will display the questions and possible answers in sequence.
##### Radio Inputs
- The user will declare their answer for each question using the radio inputs. There are three labelled 'A', 'B', and 'C', which each correspond with the answer directly below.
##### Submit Button
- Once an option has been selected by the user, they shall confirm their answer with said button. Using this button will check the user answer, keep the user score, and provide the next question.
##### Score Counter
- The simple numerical score counter exists outside of the quiz area and will inform the user how well they are doing.
##### Features to be added
- In the future I would live to offer a div separate from the quiz area that provides a piece of trivia, that relates to the question, to the user.
## Design
### Layout
----------------------------
![Screenshot of site](/documentation/project2-site.png)
- The layout for my quiz is simple but effective. The site is topped with the page heading and subheading. The quiz area takes up approx. 75% of the viewport and contains all interactive features of the quiz within it. Below the quiz area there is the score counter.
- Within the quiz area there are 8 elements that the user will interactive with, they are:
* The question area.
* Three pairs of radio inputs and answer boxes.
* A submit button.
### Color Scheme
----------------------------
- The colour scheme of blue and red was chosen for its classically compatible contrast. 
- The page background an image of a red stage curtain, as one would find in an old school or vintage movie theatre; this therefore works thematically as well as aesthetically. 
- The background for the quiz area and score counter is a rich blue with a soft white gradient. This image was selected purposefully as a solid primary colour can appear basic and unappealing to modern users.
- The font color is an off-white marble color, chosen over white to soften the contrast against both the red of the background and the blue of the quiz area.
- Upon submission of a correct answer the submit button will flash a pale green and read "Correct!" to indicate a correct answer. The button will read "Wrong!" if the answer is incorrect.
